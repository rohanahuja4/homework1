What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge combines changes from one branch into another, preserving branch 
history with merge commits. Rebase moves the entire branch to a new base 
commit, creating a linear history but rewriting commit history.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository in Git is a copy of a repository that is hosted on 
a different server or location. It allows multiple users to collaborate 
on the same project by providing a centralized place to store and share 
code.
